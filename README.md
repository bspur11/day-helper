Week 5: Third-Party API's Challenge

## Description

This site was designed using Module 5's 3rd party API's. This project is a day scheduler for one's workday and runs from 9 to 5.
It uses local storage to store the inputs using the save icon and then delete those inputs using the delete (trashcan) icon.
